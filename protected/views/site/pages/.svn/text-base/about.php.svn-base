<h1>What is the C치tedra SAES-UMU?</h1>

<p> <strong>SAES (Sociedad An칩nima de Electronica Submarina)</strong> and the <strong>University of Murcia (UMU)</strong> signed the 
<strong>C치tedra SAES-UMU</strong>, a private initiative where a set of tools based on open-source software are being designed and developed. 
These tools are used to validate different developments in the field of submarine electronics and acoustics, the main aim of SAES.</p>
<p>This <strong>C치tedra SAES-UMU</strong> initiative is created in the context of the continuous improvement process of the company, 
	paying special attention to increasing the current quality level of the internal software development processes. It is based on several 
	years of continuous collaboration between SAES and the University of Murcia, that since 2006 are collaborating in common projects and initiatives.
This initiative is also the base for current and future research and knowledge transfer activities in the context of open source software and real 
time and critical applications and services.</p>
